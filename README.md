## Welcome 

Welcome to the Corpus Studies workshop for the SMT Jazz Interest Group (2019).

Today we will:

- Discuss how corpus studies might be useful for your research. 
- Discuss the constraints and issues related to corpus studies.
- Look at the essential tools and datasets.

## Installation

- You might want to consider installing **git** if you don't already have it. There's a nice guide on how to do this on the [Humdrum website.](http://www.humdrum.org/install/github/#installing-git)
